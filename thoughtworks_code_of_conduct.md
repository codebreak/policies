# ThoughtWorks San Francisco Event Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of ThoughtWorks San Francisco events is to be inclusive to a diverse group of people from all walks of life. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof). 

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our events, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in ThoughtWorks San Francisco events to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all event participants:

  * Participate in an authentic and active way. 
  * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
  * Attempt collaboration before conflict. 
  * Respect that people have differences in opinion and that there is seldom a right answer.
  * Ask about gender rather than assume, and if you get it wrong apologize and use what they prefer.
  * Photography is encouraged, but participants must be given a chance to opt out from being photographed. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).
  * Alcohol may be present at our events but please do not feel obligated to drink.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable at our events:

  * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
  * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  * Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
  * Inappropriate photography or recording.
  * Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's verbal consent before touching them. Dressing or acting a certain way is not consent.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
  * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

## 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior


If a participant engages in an inappropriate behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem necessary including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed or have any other concerns please contact an organizer immediately. 

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

Please remember that mistakes happen, you are not a bad person, simply reassess your behavior and do better next time.

##5. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the event organizer as soon as possible. If you are not comfortable to speak to an organizer please feel free to send your concerns or any feedback to sf-event@thoughtworks.com.

## 6. Scope

We expect all event participants (contributors; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct at all ThoughtWorks San Francisco events--online and in-person.
